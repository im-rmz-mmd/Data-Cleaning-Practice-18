# 🚘 Car Theft Analysis with Power BI  
*A Compact Yet Powerful Dashboard*

---

### 🛠 Project Overview

From **cleaning messy data in Python** and handling data type conversions,  
to **building relationships between tables** — everything was prepared to build a clear picture of the car theft landscape.

Then I moved to **Power BI** to break down the data through multiple visual angles:

- 🚗 **Most stolen vehicle types**
- 🎨 **Most targeted vehicle colors**
- 🌍 **Regions with the highest theft frequency**

### 🎯 What I Learned

This project helped me shift from just *"drawing charts"*  
to **real-world data analysis** and **storytelling with dashboards**.

> A compact experience — but highly practical and insightful.
